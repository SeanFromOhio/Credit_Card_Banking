# Credit_Card_Banking is a project that simulates basic functionality of a banking app
# Generates a credit card number using Luhn's Alogorithm and a randomly generated pin
# You may login, add income, check your balance, transfer to other stored card numbers
# and delete your account.
# This gave me hands on practice utilizing SQL and SQLite database, along with function
# management and the bug detection on PyCharm.
